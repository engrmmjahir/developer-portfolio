        <h3>Frontend Web Developer</h3>
        <p>Iâ€™m a Web developer who is passionate about making error-free websites with 100% client satisfaction. I have
            a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as publicly as possible. I love to solve
            real-world problems. I am strategic, goal-oriented, and always work with an end goal in mind. Over the past
            years, I created 15s of websites for my clients. I pride myself on doing quality work and maintain excellent
            communication. Most of the time I work with WordPress but some technologies I enjoy working with include
            ReactJS, JavaScript as well as PHP.
